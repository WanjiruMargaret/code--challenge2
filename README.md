# Event Guest List Manager

## Introduction

This project is a simple **Event Guest List Manager** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to manage a guest list directly in the browser without any page reloads.

You’ll find features such as form handling, dynamic DOM updates, and interaction-based functionality like removing guests and toggling RSVP status.
